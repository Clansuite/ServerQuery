# Clansuite Server Query

Clansuite Server Query is a PHP library that allows you to query
game and voice servers. See [list of supported servers](SUPPORTED_SERVERS.md).

It is a full rewrite of the deprecated gsQuery by Jeremias Reith.
Also inspired by projects like hlsw, kquery, squery, GameQ and phgstats.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.2+

## Installation

`composer require clansuite/gameserverquery`

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$factory = new Clansuite\ServerQuery\CSQuery();
$server = $factory->createInstance('Quake3a', '172.104.253.108', 27980);

if ($server->query_server()) {
    // Get JSON output
    $json = $server->toJson();

    // Get HTML table output
    $html = $server->toHtml();

    echo $html; // Display in browser
}
```

### Web Interface

Use the included web interface:

```bash
# JSON output (default)
curl "http://localhost/serializer.php?protocol=Quake3a&host=172.104.253.108&queryport=27980"

# HTML output
curl "http://localhost/serializer.php?protocol=Quake3a&host=172.104.253.108&queryport=27980&format=html"
```

The HTML output provides a styled table view of server information, players, and server rules.

### Capture Tool

To capture network packets for testing fixtures:

```bash
php bin/capture 192.168.1.10 27015 source
```

This saves fixtures in `/tests/fixtures/` for reliable testing without external dependencies.

Configuration is in `/config/capture_config.php`.

## Testing

Testing a server query library requires validating its ability to communicate
with real game or voice servers and correctly parse their responses.

To ensure reliability and compatibility across different server implementations,
itâ€™s helpful to cross-reference results with established server monitoring
and listing platforms, such as:

- https://www.gametracker.com/
- https://listforge.net/
- https://gamemonitoring.net/
- https://www.battlemetrics.com/servers/ark

These services provide up-to-date server status, player counts, and metadata,
making them valuable benchmarks for verifying the accuracy and robustness
of a server query protocol implementation.
